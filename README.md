# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction.ipynb

Problem definition:

There are many things we consider before buying a mobile as we use our mobile for various purposes
like connecting with our family & Office Colleagues, playing games, and taking photos to keep our
memory alive. So such specifications as RAM, internal memory, Wi-Fi, 3G/4G connectivity, etc. play
important role to buy a mobile. To the analysis of this important factor from time to time and come up
with the best setoff specifications and price ranges so that people will buy the mobile. Hence through the
various ML modules, we will help the company to estimate the price of mobiles according to features so
the maximum amount of sell will be possible.

EDA on given Data set:

Digging into data we understand that

1. There is no null and missing value in the data set.
2. There are mainly 21 Features.
3. Dependent variable should be considered as Price Range.
4. There are Factors affecting the dependent variable such as RAM, Battery Power,
camera, etc .
5. The heatmap gives a good correlation between the given Feature.

Models used :

∙ KNN
∙ Random Forest
∙ Gradient Boosting Classifier
∙ XGBClassifier
∙ Logistic Regression
∙ Decision Tree Classifier
∙ Support Vector Machine
∙ Gridsearch CV
Conclusion:
∙ RAM in mobile phones is a very important feature for the price range prediction of mobile . as the
ram and battery power increase the price range increases.
∙ According to the user specifications the camera plays the role of attracting the
customer. ∙ Customer prefers the longer Battery backup for long-lasting.
∙ kneighbors classifier is giving the best results for this dataset.
∙ We build a predictive model, which could help companies estimate the price of mobiles effectively.
